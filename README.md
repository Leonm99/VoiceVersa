Android Transcription App  

The Main focus is to Transcribe voice messages (or any other audio/video file) when you dont want/cant play the audio, for example when youre at work or in public transport.

Just share the voice message (or any other audio/video file) and a Overlay will open wich then loads your Transcribed message for you to read.
