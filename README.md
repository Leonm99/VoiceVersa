Android Transcription App  

The Main focus is to Transcribe voice messages (or any other audio/video file) when you dont want to or cant play the audio, for example when youre at work or in public transport.

Just share the voice message (or any other audio/video file) and an Overlay will open wich then loads your Transcribed message for you to read/summarize/translate.
